# Dataset-on-Wholesale-Customers
I used the wholesale customers dataset to use the required libraries in R, and create compelling visualizations.

Link to the dataset:

Some of the key features of this project are: 
• Used k-means clustering
• Created visualizations to depict outliers 
• Removed the categorical variables
• Used cluster plots to visualize the resulting data
• Visualized the scaled data in the form of a cluster plot for the 3, 4, and 5 clusters
